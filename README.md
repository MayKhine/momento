# Momento

> Build habits, keep momentum.

## Why

Rebooting my coding rhythm with a personal tracker project. Momento is a minimal habit/projects app designed for _me first_, with a path to public later.

## MVP (Phase 1: Personal)

- To do page (create, edit, delete)
- Projects (create/rename/archive)
- Habits under a project (2–5 to start)
- Today check-in (checkboxes + optional note)
- Progress basics (streak + % complete)
- Local-only persistence (no auth)

## Core Concepts

- **To Do**: general tasks
- **Project**: container for habits + intent and (optional) duration
- **Habit**: a daily/weekly action (e.g., “Code 45m”, “Read docs”)
- **Daily Log**: date-stamped completion + optional note
- **Stats**: streaks and completion percent

## Tech

- Vite + React + TypeScript optional
- Local state + localStorage adapter
- ESLint + Prettier

## Dev Notes

I’m optimizing for _momentum_. Daily small commits > big bursts.
